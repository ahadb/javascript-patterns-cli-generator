## JavaScript Pattern Generator CLI

A tribute to JavaScript design patterns you should be well aware of. Libraries are still consistent with using these patterns
even in our modern age. You should be writing clean, health and maintainable code and especially thinking about this
as we write less and less JavaScript and are dependent on libs to do all the heavy lifting ;-)

You can use this to generate patterns for yourself in your project where needed, or if you like add anything to this
and package it up.

#### Stuff

* clone the repo
* run `npm install`
* run `node index`
* you can symlink by running `npm link`
* add any template you want or bend to your will, initial CLI code is there and reads from `tmpl` dir
* package it up for global install if you want

#### Patterns

The patterns are based off Addy Osmani's superb JavaScript [Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
